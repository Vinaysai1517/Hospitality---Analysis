# 📊 Atliq Grands: Business & Data Intelligence Dashboard Project

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Atliq Grands, a leading five-star hotel chain in India with 20 years of presence in the hospitality industry, is facing challenges due to rising competition and suboptimal decision-making. These challenges have led to a decline in market share and revenue, particularly in the luxury/business hotel segment.

To regain its competitive position, the management aims to integrate Business and Data Intelligence into strategic and operational decision-making. However, due to the absence of an in-house analytics team, Atliq Grands partnered with a third-party service provider to extract insights from historical data.

## 🎯 Objective

As a data analyst, my role was to:
Develop KPIs and metrics as per the stakeholder’s metric list.
Build a dashboard based on the mock-up provided.
Derive additional insights not explicitly mentioned in the dashboard.
Present actionable recommendations to the management.
